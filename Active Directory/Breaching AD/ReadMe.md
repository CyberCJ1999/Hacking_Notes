# Intro to Breaching Active Directory
Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, we need initial access first. 

We need to acquire an initial set of valid AD credentials. Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant.

We will cover the following techniques used to recover AD credentials in the network:  
  
- [NTLM Authentication](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Breaching%20AD/NTLM%20Authenticated%20Services.md)  

- LDAP Bind Credentials
- Authentication Relays  

- [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Breaching%20AD/Microsoft%20Deployment%20Toolkit.md)
- Configuration Files
