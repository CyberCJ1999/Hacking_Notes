# Intro to Enumerating AD

Once we have that first set of AD credentials and the means to authenticate with them on the network. 

We can start enumerating various details about the AD setup and structure with authenticated access, even super low-privileged access.

Enumeration will usually lead to us being able to perform some form of privilege escalation or lateral movement to gain additional access until we have sufficient privileges to execute and reach our goals.
