# Intro to Exploiting AD

After breaching AD and enumerating the structure of the domains, we will now explore different methods that could be used to exploit misconfigurations that may have surfaced from our enumeration.  

This phase exploits misconfigurations to perform a combination of lateral movement and privilege escalation until we reach a suitable position to execute our goals, as shown in the diagram below. This phase is usually combined with persistence to ensure that we can't lose the new position we gain, but this will be covered in the next room. It is also usually combined with additional enumeration since our new position might allow us to acquire additional information about the lay of the land.
