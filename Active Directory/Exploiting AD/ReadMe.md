# Intro to Exploiting AD

After breaching AD and enumerating the structure of the domains, we will now explore different methods that could be used to exploit misconfigurations that may have surfaced from our enumeration.  

This phase exploits misconfigurations to perform a combination of lateral movement and privilege escalation until we reach a suitable position to execute our goals, as shown in the diagram below. This phase is usually combined with persistence to ensure that we can't lose the new position we gain, but this will be covered in the next room. It is also usually combined with additional enumeration since our new position might allow us to acquire additional information about the lay of the land.  

Techniques for Exploiting AD:  

- [Exploiting Permission Delegation](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Exploiting%20AD/Exploiting%20Permission%20Delegation.md)

- [Exploiting Kerberos Delegation](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Exploiting%20AD/Exploiting%20Kerberos%20Delegation.md)

- [Exploiting Automated Relays]

- [Exploiting AD Users]

- [Exploiting GPOs](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Exploiting%20AD/Exploiting%20GPOs.md)

- [Exploiting Certificates](https://github.com/CyberCJ1999/Hacking_Notes/blob/main/Active%20Directory/Exploiting%20AD/Exploiting%20Certificates.md)

## Mitigations
AD exploitation, like AD enumeration, is incredibly hard to defend against.  

However, we can configure a couple of things to protect against exploitation:
- Ensure no configuration breaks tiering model. Accounts in a lower tier should not have the ability to interact with resources in a higher tier  
- Principle of least privilege should be followed when permission delegation is performed
- SMB signing should be enforced, not just enabled (prevent credential relay attempts)
- AD objects and their configuration are not the only paths for exploitation. AD services, such as AD CS should be considered as part of the attack surface and secured
- Implement sufficient security controls to protect Tier 0 infrastructure and accounts in our child domains since a compromise of one can lead to the compromise of the entire forest
